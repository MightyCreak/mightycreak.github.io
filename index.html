I'm maintaining two main projects:

# Mesamatrix

Mesamatrix is a web site that tracks the commits of the open-source [mesa](http://mesa3d.org/) drivers. It parses the
[features.txt](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/docs/features.txt) file for each commits and track, in time,
when a feature appeared and for which driver.

# Diffuse

Diffuse is a GUI application that allows to compare text files. It is written in Python and is a fork of the original
application [here](http://diffuse.sourceforge.net/).

My first work has been to modernize the source code and convert it from Python 2 to 3, and from GTK 2 to 3.
